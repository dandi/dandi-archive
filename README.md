*DANDI: Distributed Archives for Neurophysiology Data Integration*

DANDI is a platform for publishing, sharing, and processing neurophysiology data
funded by the [BRAIN Initiative](https://braininitiative.nih.gov/). The archive
accepts cellular neurophysiology data including electrophysiology,
optophysiology, and behavioral time-series, and images from immunostaining
experiments. The platform is [now available](https://dandiarchive.org/) for data
upload and distribution. For instructions on how to interact with the archive
see [the handbook](https://www.dandiarchive.org/handbook/).

## Structure

This repository contains a Django-based backend to run the DANDI REST API, and a
Vue-based [frontend](web/) to provide a user interface to the archive.

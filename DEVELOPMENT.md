# Development Guidelines

## Develop with Docker (recommended quickstart)
This is the simplest configuration for developers to start with.

## Instructions for local development with front-end hot reloading

1. Ensure you have installed Docker on your local machine
2. Run `./admin_dev_startup.sh <fun-image-name-you-can-pick> <your-email>`.  When prompted, enter an username and password in the command prompt. (If you run into local errors with the script, you may need to run `chmod +x admin_dev_startup.sh` first)
3. Navigate to `localhost:8000/admin`, and log in with the username and password you used in Step #2.  Under the `User` section, select the username and change the `Status` from `Incomplete` to `Approved`.
4. Navigate to `localhost:8085` and select `LOG IN WITH GITHUB`.

### Application Maintenance
Occasionally, new package dependencies or schema changes will necessitate
maintenance. To non-destructively update your development stack at any time:
1. Run `docker-compose pull`
2. Run `docker-compose build --pull --no-cache`
3. Run `docker-compose run --rm django ./manage.py migrate`

## Develop Natively (advanced)
This configuration still uses Docker to run attached services in the background,
but allows developers to run Python code on their native system.

### Initial Setup
1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
2. Run `docker-compose -f ./docker-compose.yml up -d`
3. Install Python 3.11
4. Install
  [`psycopg2` build prerequisites](https://www.psycopg.org/docs/install.html#build-prerequisites).
  Example `psycopg2` installation on Ubuntu 20.04:
  ```
  sudo apt install libpq-dev
  export PATH=/usr/lib/postgresql/X.Y/bin/:$PATH
  pip install psycopg2
  ```
5. Create and activate a new Python virtualenv
6. Run `pip install -e .[dev]`
7. Run `source ./dev/export-env.sh`
8. Run `./manage.py migrate`
9. Run `./manage.py createcachetable`
10. Run `./manage.py createsuperuser` and follow the prompts to create your own user
11. Run `./manage.py create_dev_dandiset --owner your.email@email.com`
   to create a dummy dandiset to start working with.

### Run Application
1. Ensure `docker-compose -f ./docker-compose.yml up -d` is still active
2. Run:
   1. `source ./dev/export-env.sh`
   2. `./manage.py runserver`
3. Run in a separate terminal:
   1. `source ./dev/export-env.sh`
   2. `celery --app dandiapi.celery worker --loglevel INFO --without-heartbeat -Q celery,calculate_sha256,ingest_zarr_archive -B`
4. When finished, run `docker-compose stop`

## Remap Service Ports (optional)
Attached services may be exposed to the host system via alternative ports. Developers who work
on multiple software projects concurrently may find this helpful to avoid port conflicts.

To do so, before running any `docker-compose` commands, set any of the environment variables:
* `DOCKER_POSTGRES_PORT`
* `DOCKER_RABBITMQ_PORT`
* `DOCKER_MINIO_PORT`

The Django server must be informed about the changes:
* When running the "Develop with Docker" configuration, override the environment variables:
  * `DJANGO_MINIO_STORAGE_MEDIA_URL`, using the port from `DOCKER_MINIO_PORT`.
* When running the "Develop Natively" configuration, override the environment variables:
  * `DJANGO_DATABASE_URL`, using the port from `DOCKER_POSTGRES_PORT`
  * `DJANGO_CELERY_BROKER_URL`, using the port from `DOCKER_RABBITMQ_PORT`
  * `DJANGO_MINIO_STORAGE_ENDPOINT`, using the port from `DOCKER_MINIO_PORT`

Since most of Django's environment variables contain additional content, use the values from
the appropriate `dev/.env.docker-compose*` file as a baseline for overrides.

## Testing
### Initial Setup
tox is used to execute all tests.
tox is installed automatically with the `dev` package extra.
To install the tox pytest dependencies into your environment, run `pip install -e .[test]`.
These are useful for IDE autocompletion or if you want to run `pytest` directly (not recommended).

When running the "Develop with Docker" configuration, all tox commands must be run as
`docker-compose run --rm django tox`; extra arguments may also be appended to this form.

### Running Tests
Run `tox` to launch the full test suite.

Individual test environments may be selectively run.
This also allows additional options to be be added.
Useful sub-commands include:
* `tox -e lint`: Run only the style checks
* `tox -e type`: Run only the type checks
* `tox -e test`: Run only the pytest-driven tests
* `tox -e test -- -k test_file`: Run the pytest-driven tests that match the regular expression `test_file`
* `tox -e test -- --cov=dandiapi`: Generate a test coverage report
* `tox -e test -- --cov=dandiapi --cov-report=html`: Generate an HTML test coverage report in the `htmlcov` directory

To automatically reformat all code to comply with
some (but not all) of the style checks, run `tox -e format`.

### Profiling with Memray
To include a memory profile with your tests, add `--memray` at the end of your test command invocation. For example, to run a memory profile with all tests, you would run `tox -e test -- --memray`. This can be used in conjunction with other pytest CLI flags (like `-k`) as well. See the `pytest-memray` [docs](https://github.com/bloomberg/pytest-memray) for more invocation details.

#### NOTE: If you have an existing dandi-archive installation in which you have previously run tox, you may need to recreate the tox environment (by adding `-r` to your tox invocation) the first time you attempt to use memray. If your attempt to use the `--memray` flag fails with `pytest: error: unrecognized arguments: --memray`, this is likely why.

## dandiarchive.org WEB Interface

This repository now also contains sources for the web interface under [web/](./web/) folder.
If you would like to develop it locally, please see [web/README.md](./web/README.md) file for instructions.

## API Authentication
Read-only API endpoints (i.e. `GET`, `HEAD`) do not require any
authentication. All other endpoints require token authentication
to call.

### Creating a Token
Visit the URL `/admin` with a web browser, logging
in with the credentials entered during the `createsuperuser` setup step..
Then go to `/swagger` and use `GET /auth/token` end-point.

### Supplying the Token
In API endpoint calls, add the `Authorization` HTTP header with a value of
`Token <token_value>`. For example, for a token `1234`, include the header:
`Authorization: Token 1234`.

## Scripts

For frequent deployment administration tasks, `django-extensions` provides a convenient way to write and run scripts that execute in the Django context.

### create_dev_dandiset

```
python manage.py create_dev_dandiset --owner your.email@email.com --name My Dummy Dandiset
```

This creates a dummy dandiset with valid metadata and a single dummy asset.
The dandiset should be valid and publishable out of the box.
This script is a simple way to get test data into your DB without having to use dandi-cli.

### import_dandisets
```
python manage.py import_dandisets [API_URL] --all
```

This imports all dandisets (versions + metadata only, no assets) from the dandi-api deployment
living at `API_URL`. For example, to import all dandisets from the production server into your
local dev environment, run `python manage.py import_dandisets https://api.dandiarchive.org` from
your local terminal. Note that if a dandiset with the same identifier as the one being imported
already exists, that dandiset will not be imported.

```
python manage.py import_dandisets [API_URL] --all --replace
```

Same as the previous example, except if a dandiset with the same identifier as the one being imported
already exists, the existing dandiset will be replaced with the one being imported.

```
python manage.py import_dandisets [API_URL] --all --offset 100000
```

This imports all dandisets (versions + metadata only, no assets) from the dandi-api deployment
living at `API_URL` and offsets their identifiers by 100000. This is helpful if you want to import
a dandiset that has the same identifier as one already in your database.

```
python manage.py import_dandisets [API_URL] --identifier 000005
```

This imports dandiset 000005 from `API_URL` into your local dev environment. Note that if there is already
a dandiset with an identifier of 000005, nothing will happen. Use the --replace flag to have the script
overwrite it instead if desired.

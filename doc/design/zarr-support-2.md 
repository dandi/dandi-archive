# Abstract

Zarr files are stored in their entirety in S3.
Zarr files are represented by a single Asset through the API.
A treehash is computed as the zarr file is uploaded.
Each node in the treehash in the hash is stored in S3 to avoid bloating the DB.
When published, the zarr file is copied to a separate location in the bucket so that changes to the draft cannot affect the published file.

# Requirements

1. Zarr files are stored in a "directory" in S3.
1. Each zarr file corresponds to a single Asset.
1. The CLI uses some kind of tree hashing scheme to compute a checksum for the entire zarr file.
1. The API verifies the checksum _immediately_ after upload.
1. The system can theoretically handle zarr files with ~1 million subfiles, each of size 64 * 64 * 64 bytes ~= 262 kilobytes.
1. Zarr metadata must be mutable for zarr files in draft dandisets.

# Implementation

## API endpoints

* POST /api/zarr_files/
  Start a new zarr file.
  Returns a zarr ID
* GET /api/zarr_files/{zarr_id}/
  Returns some information about the zarr file, like name, S3 path+url, and checksum
* POST /api/zarr_files/{zarr_id}/batch/start/
  Ask to upload a batch of subfiles as part of the zarr file.
  No more batch uploads are permitted until this one is completed or aborted.
  Requires a list of file paths and ETags (md5 checksums)
  The file paths may include already uploaded files; this is how updates are done.
  Returns a list of presigned upload URLs
* POST /api/zarr_files/{zarr_id}/batch/complete/
  Completes an upload of a batch of subfiles.
  Fail if any of the checksums do not match.
  Also, recursively update the tree hash for every parent node for each child.
* DELETE /api/zarr_files/{zarr_id}/batch/
  Cancels a batch upload.
  Any files already uploaded are deleted.
  A new batch upload can then be started.
* DELETE /api/zarr_files/{zarr_id}/batch/delete/
  Deletes subfiles from S3, and updates the treehash accordingly.
  Requires a list of file paths

* POST /api/dandisets/{...}/versions/{...}/assets/zarr/{zarr_id}/
  Creates a new Asset that points to this zarr data.
  Return an asset ID

## Upload flow

TODO the only gotcha is that published zarr files can't be uploaded to/updated/deleted from
The slowest API request in the upload flow is the `.../batch/complete/` operation, since it needs to update several `.checksum` files in S3.
I recommend that the CLI dynamically adjust batch size to keep the `.../batch/complete/` operation under 30s.

## Modification flow

TODO this is basically the same as the upload flow, but with deletes allowed.

## Hashing scheme

To avoid having to store a checksum for every directory in every zarr file, we will delegate the storage of the checksums to S3.
Update times will be substantially slower since each level of the tree needs to be updated.
Storage costs will be offloaded to S3, and the treehash will be conveniently accessible to clients.

Let's say the zarr files are kept under `/zarr/{zarr_id}/...` in S3.
A subfile `1/2/3/4.txt` of zarr file `foobar` would be kept at `/zarr/foobar/1/2/3/4.txt`.
The ETag can be trivially determined by a `HEAD` request to that S3 object.

After this subfile is uploaded, the API server creates a file `/zarr_checksums/foobar/1/2/3/.checksum` if it doesn't already exist (note the altered prefix).
This file contains a list of all the files/directories currently in the directory, their checksums, and an aggregated checksum of the entire directory contents.
If `.checksum` already exists, it is updated with the new file+ETag and the final checksum is updated.

The API server then recursively travels up another level and creates `/zarr_checksums/foobar/1/2/.checksum`.
This `.checksum` will contain an entry for the directory `3` and the final checksum from `3/.checksum`.
This recursion continues all the way to the top, yielding a `/zarr_checksums/foobar/.checksum` file which contains an aggregated checksum for the entire zarr file.

### .checksum file format

TODO
TODO include sha256 as it is calculated? are we even calculating sha256 for zarr files?

### Treehash algorithm

TODO it obviously needs to include all the checksums for all the files in the directory, but assembled how?

## Publishing

When a dandiset containing a zarr file is published, normal Assets are simply added to the new published dandiset, which is a DB only operation and therefore very fast.
This doesn't work for zarr files, since we want to make sure that subsequent modifications to the draft zarr file don't impact the published zarr file.

Fortunately, fast publishing is not a requirement for dandisets, just a happy coincidedence of our deduplication scheme.
On publish, simply trigger a job that copies the zarr file S3 data to a new location (TODO where is that exactly?).
Immediately after publishing, the zarr data will be incomplete while the S3 copy is still in progress.
The UI communicates the current status of the published version and alerts the user that because their dandiset contains zarr files, publish may take some time.
